# Hospital-Patient-Records-Analysis

Problem Statement
Modern healthcare systems generate large amounts of patient, clinical, and financial records. However, hospitals often struggle to convert this raw data into meaningful insights that improve patient care, operational efficiency, and financial decision-making.

This project aims to analyze hospital encounter-level data using SQL to uncover critical insights related to patient behavior, procedures, payer coverage, and healthcare utilization patterns.

The dataset contains four primary tables:

patients — Patient demographics such as birthdate, gender, race, and ZIP.

encounters — Each hospital interaction, including encounter type, start/end time, cost, and payer.

procedures — Procedures performed during encounters, along with categories and base cost.

payers — Insurance or coverage information for encounters.
